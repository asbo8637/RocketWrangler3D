# RocketWrangler3D

Run make
run ./RocketWrangler3D

If that doesn't work. I've attempted to make a dist folder. Just run ./RocketWrangler3D on linux or ./RocketWrangler3D.exe for windows

Controls: 
WASD: For moving around
Space: to jump off a rocket
F: for full screen
Esc: to escape

No camera controls(Well there are some remenants, but ignore that)


Your goal is to wrangle some rockets. Jump off the current rocket and use some rudimentary air controls to try and land on another rocket. You have one ground bounce. Don't go through the walls yet :\


Things still to do. Explosions, sounds, rocket model, rocket thrust, character textures, Upgrade hat( I want a cowboy hat), wall bounce physics
